# 🛡️ Phishing Email Analysis

## 📌 Task Objective

As part of my cybersecurity internship, I was assigned the task of analyzing a phishing email to better understand how these scams work, what red flags to look for, and how to protect against them.

## 🧠 What I Did

I used a publicly available phishing email example (pretending to be from PayPal) and broke it down to identify various indicators of phishing, such as spoofed sender addresses, misleading links, and psychological manipulation like urgency and fear tactics. I’ve also attached a screenshot of the phishing email as part of the analysis.

## 📁 Files Included

- `phishing_report.md` – My full written analysis of the email
- `screenshots/phishing_email.png` – A screenshot of the phishing email used

## 🔍 Outcome

Through this task, I gained better awareness of how phishing emails are crafted and how attackers try to deceive people into giving up personal or login information. This was a valuable hands-on exercise in email threat analysis.
